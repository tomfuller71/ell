    "### Foundational Guidance from ChatGPT on best practises\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices for creating multiple-choice questions and options:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question Writing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clarity: Ensure the question is clear and unambiguous.\n",
    "- Focus: Test a single, specific concept or skill.\n",
    "- Relevance: Relate the question directly to the key learning objectives.\n",
    "- Avoid Trick Questions: Ensure the question doesn't rely on confusing wording or unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "- Balance Complexity: Aim for moderate difficulty, avoiding overly simple or overly complex questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option Writing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plausible Distractors: All options (distractors) should seem plausible to less knowledgeable students.\n",
    "- Single Correct Answer: Only one option should be clearly correct.\n",
    "- Consistent Length: Avoid making the correct answer noticeably longer or shorter than the distractors.\n",
    "- Avoid Negative Wording: If unavoidable, highlight the negative (e.g., not).\n",
    "- Mutually Exclusive: Options should not overlap in meaning.\n",
    "- Avoid \"All of the Above\"/\"None of the Above\": These can confuse or test for test-taking strategies rather than knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty Rating (1 to 5 Scale):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"1\" Easy:\n",
    "    - Tests basic recall of facts or definitions.\n",
    "    - Requires minimal cognitive effort.\n",
    "    - Candidates can answer quickly without much analysis.\n",
    "- \"2\" Below Moderate:\n",
    "    - Involves basic understanding or straightforward application of concepts.\n",
    "    - May require recognition of patterns or simple reasoning.\n",
    "- \"3\" Moderate:\n",
    "    - Requires applying concepts in new or slightly varied contexts.\n",
    "    - Involves some critical thinking and deeper understanding.\n",
    "    - Slightly more complex than a simple recall.\n",
    "- \"4\" Hard:\n",
    "    - Requires significant analysis, problem-solving, or synthesis.\n",
    "    - May involve multiple concepts or require candidates to infer information.\n",
    "    - Challenging for most candidates, requiring both time and thought.\n",
    "- \"5\" Very Hard:\n",
    "    - Requires advanced critical thinking, evaluation, or comprehensive understanding.\n",
    "    - May involve abstract concepts or complex scenarios.\n",
    "    - Likely to challenge even the top-performing candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question Rating(1-5 scale):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a scale for how well a multiple-choice question fits the evaluation criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"1\" Poor:\n",
    "    - The question is unclear or ambiguous, making it difficult for students to understand.\n",
    "    - The question is irrelevant or does not assess an important learning objective.\n",
    "    - Distractors are implausible or obviously incorrect.\n",
    "    - The options are unbalanced (e.g., the correct answer stands out due to length or wording).\n",
    "    - The question may have more than one plausible answer or is biased.\n",
    "- \"2\" Below Average:\n",
    "    - The question is somewhat clear but may contain minor ambiguities.\n",
    "    - The question relates to the content but does not target key concepts or skills.\n",
    "    - Distractors are weak but somewhat plausible.\n",
    "    - Some imbalance in options (e.g., the correct answer is slightly longer or more detailed).\n",
    "    - The question is somewhat fair but might confuse less knowledgeable students.\n",
    "- \"3\" Average:\n",
    "    - The question is generally clear but could be improved for better understanding.\n",
    "    - The question is relevant to learning objectives but might be too broad or narrow.\n",
    "    - Distractors are reasonably plausible but not challenging enough.\n",
    "    - The options are mostly balanced, with minor improvements needed.\n",
    "    - The question is fair, with a clear correct answer and minimal bias.\n",
    "- \"4\" Good:\n",
    "    - The question is clear and concise with no ambiguities.\n",
    "    - The question effectively targets key learning objectives or skills.\n",
    "    - Distractors are plausible and make the question moderately challenging.\n",
    "    - The options are well-balanced, with no standout option based on length or structure.\n",
    "    - The question is fair and unbiased, with a well-defined correct answer.\n",
    "- \"5\" Excellent:\n",
    "    - The question is exceptionally clear and concise, easy to understand with no ambiguities.\n",
    "    - The question is highly relevant, focusing directly on key learning objectives.\n",
    "    - Distractors are carefully crafted, highly plausible, and challenging for all students.\n",
    "    - The options are perfectly balanced in length, structure, and content.\n",
    "    - The question is completely fair, with no bias or confusion, and has a single, well-defined correct answer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This scale allows you to assess and refine questions based on how well they align with the evaluation criteria for clarity, relevance, plausibility, balance, and fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mix of questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For setting 10 multiple-choice questions with difficulty levels.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Balanced Distribution: Aim for a mixture of difficulties that covers a wide range of skills and understanding levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 2 easy (1): Questions that test basic recall or fundamental concepts.\n",
    "    - 3 below-moderate / moderate (2-3): Questions that require some application of knowledge or understanding of concepts.\n",
    "    - 3 difficult (4): Questions that challenge critical thinking or deeper understanding.\n",
    "    - 2 very difficult (5): Questions that test advanced knowledge or complex problem-solving.\n",
    "- Progressive Difficulty: Arrange the questions so they gradually increase in difficulty to help build student confidence early on. For example:\n",
    "    - Questions 1-2: Difficulty 1 (easy)\n",
    "    - Questions 3-5: Difficulty 2-3 (moderate)\n",
    "    - Questions 6-8: Difficulty 4 (hard)\n",
    "    - Questions 9-10: Difficulty 5 (very hard)\n",
    "- Cover All Key Topics: Ensure questions cover a range of topics or learning objectives, not just focusing on the hardest or easiest parts of the content.\n",
    "- Testing Different Cognitive Skills: Use easy questions for simple recall, moderate ones for application, and hard ones for analysis, synthesis, or evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the exam fairly assesses both foundational knowledge and higher-order thinking."

(Assume no volume change upon HCl addition and that the temperature remains constant.)\n",

      "A. The pH of the solution decreases slightly due to the common ion effect, as added HCl suppresses the ionization of acetic acid, while acetate ions react with H+ ions to form acetic acid. ✅\n",
      "When HCl is added, it provides excess H+ ions. These protons will react with the acetate ions (CH3COO-) to form additional acetic acid (CH3COOH), thus causing a slight decrease in the pH. This buffer action primarily follows the principle of Le Chatelier as the system tries to counteract the effect of the added H+ by forming more CH3COOH. The presence of the acetate ion (a common ion) suppresses further ionization of CH3COOH due to common ion effect, thus buffering the pH decline.\n",

      "B. The pH of the solution increases due to the common ion effect from the added HCl. ❌\n",

      "C. The concentration of acetate ions increases, counteracting the addition of HCl. ❌\n",
